# Ludum Dare 35

The chosen theme for Ludum Dare 35 was 'Shapeshifter'

The game we chose to develop revolves around the evolution of two frogs as they compete against each other to collect food in a 2D arena. Currently available as Local Coop gameplay, we have chosen to continue this development past the Ludum deadline during times that uni permits.
